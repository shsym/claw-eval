## Leaderboard

Browse the full leaderboard and individual task cases at **[claw-eval.github.io](https://claw-eval.github.io)**.

**Evaluation Logic:**
* **Current Display:** Results are based on a single trial ($N=1$).
* **Pass Criterion (3 Trials):** For multi-trial runs, a task is marked as passed if the **mean score > 0.75**.

## Quick Start

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast, reliable dependency management:

```bash
pip install uv
uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Prepare your keys and set up the environments with one command:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
export SERP_DEV_KEY=... # add this for tasks need real web search
bash scripts/test_sandbox.sh
```

Go rock 🚀

```bash
claw-eval batch --config model_configs/claude_opus_46.yaml --sandbox --trials 3 --parallel 16
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] More real-world, multimodal tasks in complex productivity environments
- [ ] Comprehensive, fine-grained scoring logic with deep state verification
- [ ] Enhanced sandbox isolation and full-trace tracking for transparent, scalable evaluation
